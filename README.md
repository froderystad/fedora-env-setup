Fedora Environment Setup
========================

This project contains scripts that takes a plain vanilla Fedora 20 installation, and sets it up to be a decent development workstation.

This script is expecting that the following pre-requisites are met:
 * [Fedora 20 (64 bit)](http://fedoraproject.org/), with the standard software packages installed from Live DVD.
 * The user running the scripts is administrator (i.e. 'sudoer'). This can be configured during installation.

The installation has been tested on Fedora 20 in VirtualBox with English language and Norwegian keyboard layout. It should however, work with any other languages.

If you run Fedora in a virtual machine, I recommend taking a snapshot before running the script, as it allows you to roll back all changes, modify, and rerun the scripts, if you so desire.
